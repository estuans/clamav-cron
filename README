This a modified version of the clamav-cron script by Stefano Stagnaro currently hosted on GoogleCode.
I'm including the vanilla 0.6 from GCode for the purposes of reference, and if anyone wants it.

I've also included my slightly remixed version "clamav-cron-est-0.7"

My version only emails on error, or virus detection rather then on every run.
It also rearranges the email, so the scan summary is at the top of the email, rather than the bottom.

My intention it to Pythonize the whole thing and do the output-mashing in memory, then send an email without relying on the *NIX mail command.
